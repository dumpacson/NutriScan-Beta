## Abstract
NutriScan is a mobile app developed to guide everyday shoppers in making informed decisions about the food they purchase daily. Users can key in the product name or conveniently **scan the barcode** of any product sold in grocery shops or supermarkets, and NutriScan will provide them with a comprehensive breakdown of the **nutritional information, ingredients,** including the ones with scientific names (e.g. sulfites). The app acts as a safety guide, alerting users to potential risks associated with unknown ingredients that may not be beneficial to their bodies as well as **halal detection** for Muslim users. NutriScan includes a dietary preferences checklist where users can adjust based on their lifestyle.  Additionally, it assists users in identifying **potential allergens** like peanuts or shellfish, ensuring a personalized and healthier food shopping and eating experience.

	
## Problem Statement
- Growing concern on the **unhealthy eating habits** and the lack of accessible nutritional information online in Malaysia.
- **Unavailability** of existing apps catering to these needs, shoppers are left with the difficult task of deciphering food labels or disregarding them altogether.
- Limited awareness on unknown **ingredients** in food products that may pose harm to consumers.



## Objectives
- Functional prototype of the mobile app that seamlessly integrates with an existing database. 
- Offer a detailed breakdown of the product's **nutritional facts** and also alert users about products that may **conflict with their dietary preferences.** 
- Assist users in making **informed choices** to support their dietary goals and overall well-being.
